## Tutorial

Specmonstah was born out of a need to replace brittle, repetitive code
for creating deeply-nested hierarchies of data in unit tests. This
tutorial will show you how to use Specmonstah specifically for this
use case. Along the way you'll learn how to make the most of
Specmonstah by understanding how it's not implemented to support
writing unit tests per se, but to support the more fundamental
operations of generating and manipulating entity graphs.

In trying to figure out how to explain this I had the thought,
"Specmonstah is all about _data_ and _the stuff you can do with that
data_. It felt super profound, like I had gotten a direct glimpse of
the underlying structure of the cosmos. Real "shower thoughts" moment.

We'll start with a high-level overview of how Specmonstah's `data` and
`operations` support the overall goal of aiding testing by generating
and inserting records in a database in dependency order.

### Data & Operations

Specmonstah's data and operations can be summarized as:

* Data
  * ent db
    * schema
    * ent graph
    * ent attrs
* Operations
  * add ents
  * add ent attrs (ent visitation)
  * project the ent graph

To explain Specmonstah's data and operations, we'll work through the
following questions:

* How does Specmonstah generate data for database insertion?
* How does Specmonstah insert records in the correct order?

#### Data Generation

Data generation happens in two phases:

1. You _add ents_ to an _ent db_'s _ent graph_
2. You add the data generated by clojure.spec to each ent as an _ent
   attr_

Let's unpack this a little.

Specmonstah works by generating an _ent graph_. Say you want to
generate and insert three `todo`s that references a `todo-list`, where
the `todo`s and the `todo-list` all reference a `user`.  Specmonstah
accomplishes this by first creating a graph like this:

![Simple todo example](docs/todo-example.png)

In the graph above, we call the `:todo`, `:todo-list`, and `:user`
nodes _ent types_ and the rest _ents_. We use these names in
Specmonstah to indicate that these graph nodes take on a particular
meaning in Specmonstah:

**Ent type.** An ent type is analogous to a relation in a relational
database, or a class in object-oriented programming. It differs in
that relations and classes define all the attributes of their
instances, whereas ent types don't. Ent types define how instances are
related to each other. For example, a Todo schema might include a
`:description` attribute, but the `:todo` ent type doesn't. The
`:todo` ent type _does_ specify that a `:todo` instances reference
`:todo-list` instances.

Ent types are represented as nodes in the ent graph (let's abbreviate
that with _EG_), with directed edges going from ent types to their
instances. It's rare that you'll interact with ent types directly.

**Ent.** An ent is an instance of an ent type. Ents have names (`:t0,
:u0`, etc), and reference other ents. They're represented as nodes in
the EG, with directed edges going from ents to the ents they
reference; there's a directed edge from `:tl0` to `:u0` because `:tl0`
references `:u0`. The graph's topology is used to ensure that `:u0`
gets inserted before `:tl0`.

In creating the above graph, we would say that we _add ents_ to an
_ent db_. An ent db is a map that contains an ent graph.

The ent db also contains a _schema_, which is used to construct the
directed edges between ents.

So that's the first step of data generation: You _add ents_ to an _ent
db_'s _ent graph_. After that, you add the data generated by
clojure.spec to each ent as an _ent attr_.

For example, the ent `:u0` is not a map, it's just a graph node, and
as such it cannot be inserted in a database. Specmonstah generates
data for `:u0` and then associates it with `u0` as an _ent attr_. You
can think of as being represented using a map like this:

```
{:u0 {:spec-gen {:username "billy"
                 :id       1}}}
```

In this case, the ent attr is `:spec-gen`.
